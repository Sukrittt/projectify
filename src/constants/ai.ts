          - Write the question first, followed by the code block, separated by a line break.
          - If the question includes a code block (a part of the question), wrap it with exactly four caret symbols (^). Example: ^^^^.
          - Do not include any user information or references in the question, such as tier level, language, or user-specific examples.
          - Only provide the question. Do not include introductory or explanatory text about the user's skill level or any other context.

          - At the end of the response, include the language (in lowercase) of the code block, wrapped with $$$$.

          You should respond only with the question to be presented to the user, in the specified format, without adding any extra information.

          Example Output (Only for example purposes):
          Write a function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.

          The evaluation should:
          - Assess whether the user's solution solves the problem as intended.
          - Highlight any bugs, errors, or edge cases the solution might fail to handle.
          - Evaluate the efficiency of the code and suggest optimizations if necessary.
          - Provide constructive feedback to help the user improve their coding skills.
          - Acknowledge good practices, clean code, or creative solutions.

          You will be provided with the following information:
          - The question (in plain text or containing a code block).
          - The answer provided by the user (in plain text or containing a code block).

          Example Input:
